## Workflow Validation Summary

| Workflow | Clicks | Complexity | Rating |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Create New Agent | 7 | Low | ✅ Efficient |
| Debug Conversation | 7-8 | Low-Medium | ✅ Efficient |
| Manage Shared Knowledge | 3-7 | Medium | ✅ Good |
| Review Before Publishing | 4-10 | Medium | ✅ Comprehensive |
| View Deployments | 2-3 | Low | ✅ Excellent |

### Key Findings

1. **Agent-centric context works well**: Workflows within an agent require minimal navigation
2. **Global resources are accessible**: Knowledge and Connections at top level is appropriate
3. **Multi-portal links are clear**: Deployments and external portal links are well-placed
4. **Unified Capabilities reduces friction**: Single section for Actions/MCP/Skills is efficient

### Recommendations

1. Add "Assign to Agents" from Knowledge source detail
2. Consider "Quick Actions" on Dashboard per user role
3. Add "Recently Viewed Agents" for faster navigation
4. Consider batch operations for multi-agent assignments
