## Validation Summary

### Strengths
1. **Clear role separation**: IA respects role-based access control
2. **Agent-centric navigation**: All personas can easily find and work with agents
3. **Unified Capabilities**: Developers benefit from consolidated Actions/MCP/Skills
4. **Multi-portal awareness**: Clear boundaries with Control Hub and FlowBuilder
5. **Progressive disclosure**: Complex features don't overwhelm simpler use cases

### Potential Improvements
1. Consider adding "quick actions" on Dashboard for common tasks per role
2. Add "recently viewed agents" for faster navigation
3. Consider role-specific dashboard views
4. Add onboarding tour for new users

### Conclusion
The Information Architecture effectively supports all three primary personas. The two-tier navigation (global + agent-level) provides appropriate structure, and the unified Capabilities section simplifies the developer workflow. The read-only Deployments feature appropriately addresses the multi-portal ecosystem.

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED
